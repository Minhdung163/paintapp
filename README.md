Paint app allows you to draw simple pictures on a grid.

It provides you with some options like:
+ Basics color to choose from
+ Change the brushes size 
+ Erase or clear the drawn pixels

It still has some disadvantages:
+ There are still blank space if you move the mouse too fast
+ Dont have a color board to choose the color you want
+ The lines are not connected smoothly
